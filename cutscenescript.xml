		<dialogue id = 'dialogue1'>It’s your first day. Don’t let us down! We're starting you off with 2D and 3D shapes, and one conveyor belt!</dialogue>
		<dialogue id = 'dialogue2'>Good work yesterday, 2 days left. Now we'll move you to our advanced factory area. It has 2 conveyor belts, but sadly we couldn't bring the fancy shape monitor. You'll have to recognize these shapes by name only. Good luck!</dialogue>
		<dialogue id = 'dialogue3'>Now we're going to combine all your learning from the past 2 days. The conveyor belt speeds are off the scale!</dialogue>
		<dialogue id = 'dialogue4'>It’ll get harder from this point on, we've removed the visuals of the shape because we know you don't need them. You're a pro, good luck today!</dialogue>
		<dialogue id = 'dialogue5'>We are running at top speed today! You've trained for this day, all your learning from the past 4 days will come in handy. This is our chance to save the factory.</dialogue>
