		<dialogue id = 'dialogue2'>Good work yesterday, 2 days left. Now we'll move you to our advanced factory area. It has 2 conveyor belts, but sadly we couldn't bring the fancy shape monitor. You'll have to recognize these shapes by name only. Good luck!</dialogue>
		<dialogue id = 'dialogue3'>Now we're going to combine all your learning from the past 2 days. The conveyor belt speeds are off the scale!</dialogue>
